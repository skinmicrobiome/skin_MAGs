Here we have provided the relative abundance tables of different members of the SMGC - an intermediate file to Extended Data Fig. 10 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01011-w). The file "bwa_counts-unique.csv" designates the unique reads mapping to each SMGC member while the "bwa_counts-total.csv" file designates the total reads mapping to each SMGC member. The unique reads are most suitable for quantifying relative abundance. The taxonomic affiliation associated with each SMGC member is provided in the supplementary tables of the paper or alternatively can be downloaded from http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/genome_sets/skin_microbiome/ (SMGC.xlsx). For convenience, metadata for the samples used for readmapping is also provided (metadata.txt). For futher questions: https://github.com/skinmicrobiome/skin_MAGs/issues.
